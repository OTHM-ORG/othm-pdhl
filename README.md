# othm-pdhl
Pronounced "Autumn Puddle Hole", a set of WTFPL header libraries.

These are a set of libraries made in a [similar fashion](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/docs/stb_howto.txt) to [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb).

## Why are different othm libraries under different licenses?

Some of these libraries are small and useful enough in the general sense that they should be used everywhere (and have freedom of any restrictions) that is why:

**othm-pdhl is under the WTFPL!**

I don't care much about keeping track of their use. However people tend to be too *downright boring* and without a care of the effect their work has on others, this annoys me to no end, so:

**other othm libraries will tend to be GPL3, be aware of your usage!**

I want to ensure my best work will not be used to make my own life more annoying by supporting work I myself cannot use, and annoying those who are all business and no science or fun. I like to make people who like the idea of free market to be disturbed, since it means a world without interesting stories, and I can't have that.
