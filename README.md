# othm-pdhl
Pronounced "Autumn Puddle", a set of WTFPL header libraries.

These are a set of libraries made in a [similar fashion](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/docs/stb_howto.txt) to [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb).

## Why are different othm libraries under different licenses?

Some of these libraries are small and useful enough in the general sense that they should be used everywhere (and have freedom of any restrictions) that is why:

**othm-pdhl is under the WTFPL!**

Other othm libraries might be under a MIT, LGPL, or GPL license.
